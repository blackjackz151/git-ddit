DDIT - git ddit ls

Important: Separate conditions with a space, values with white space and/or dates should be surrounded by quotation marks

Usage:
  git ddit ls [-q <query>...] [--verbose] [-csv] [--help]

Description:
  Lists issues in the issue repository. Can add a query to filter issues, displaying only issues that match the conditions.

Options:
  -csv <path>                          Creates a csv containing issue information
  -csvc <path>, --csv-comments <path>  Creates a csv containing comment information
  -q, --query <arg>...                 Description for new issue
  -v, --verbose                        Show full details of issues

Conditions:
  Format of condition is: qualifier:value

  Qualifiers are:
    title, description, status, tag, assignee, watcher, creator, comment, created, edited

  Value format varies depending on qualifier:
    title:"title contains"            This will display issues that contain the value string in the qualifier
    desc:"description contains"
    tag:"tag"

    status:open | status:closed      These are the two options for the status qualifier - displaying issues with open/closed status

    watcher:name | watcher:email     Displays issues with a watcher/creator/assignee with the specified name or email
    creator:name | creator:email
    assignee:name| assignee:email

    For qualifiers "created" and "edited" use of <, >, <=, and >= can be used:
    If using <, >, <=, or >= then must be surrounded by " "
    created:"[< | > | >= | <=]dd/MM/yyyy"     Displays issues created/edited on the date given if no equality operator given else will display accordingly
     edited:"[< | > | >= | <=]dd/MM/yyyy"

Example:
  git ddit ls -q title:hello desc:world status:open
  This will show issues with title: hello, description: world and a status of open.

  git ddit ls
  This will show all issues

  git ddit ls -q created:<03/02/2019 title:"hello world"
  This will show issues created before 03/02/2019 with the string "hello world" in the title
